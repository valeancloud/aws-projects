# AWS-projects

## Overview

This repository showcases the hands‑on AWS projects I’ve built to deepen my cloud engineering experience and document real-world infrastructure patterns. Each project reflects practical scenarios—designing, deploying, automating, and improving cloud environments using modern AWS services and best practices.

My focus is on creating secure, scalable, and cost‑efficient architectures while continuously experimenting, breaking things, and rebuilding them to understand how systems behave under real conditions. These projects serve as both a personal knowledge base and a reference for other engineers exploring similar designs.

To automate and standardize deployments, I rely heavily on Infrastructure as Code, including:

- **Terraform** for consistent, repeatable provisioning of AWS resources  
- **CloudFormation** for templated, streamlined deployments of specific services and architectures  

## Project Highlights

- **Real-world AWS architecture and automation examples**  
- **Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and CloudFormation**  
- **Summarized designs with sensitive details omitted**  
- **Modular patterns that support future integration and scaling**  
- **A growing reference for troubleshooting and implementation approaches**
