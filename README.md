# AWS Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands‑on AWS projects that demonstrate real-world cloud architecture, automation, and migration scenarios. Each project reflects practical experience designing, deploying, and improving cloud environments using modern AWS services and best practices.

My focus is on building secure, scalable, and cost‑efficient solutions while continuously experimenting, breaking things, and rebuilding them to understand how systems behave under real conditions. These projects serve as both a personal knowledge base and a reference for other engineers exploring similar AWS designs.

## What This Repository Showcases
- Real-world AWS architecture patterns  
- Automated deployments and cloud operations  
- Infrastructure as Code for consistent provisioning  
- Scalable, secure, and modular cloud solutions  
- Practical troubleshooting and implementation approaches  

## Tools and Technologies
I rely heavily on Infrastructure as Code and automation to standardize deployments across environments:

- **Terraform** for repeatable, consistent provisioning of AWS resources  
- **CloudFormation** for templated, service‑specific deployments  
- **AWS CLI & Bash** for automation, scripting, and operational workflows  

## Project Highlights
- End‑to‑end cloud migrations (EC2, RDS, VPC)  
- IAM automation and security enforcement at scale  
- Scalable web applications using Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB, and CloudFront  
- Static website hosting and DNS migration using S3, CloudFront, and Route 53  
- Modular patterns designed for future integration and expansion  

Each folder in this repository represents a standalone project with its own architecture, implementation details, and lessons learned.
