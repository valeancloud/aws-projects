# AWS Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands‑on AWS projects that demonstrate real-world cloud architecture, automation, and migration scenarios. Each project reflects practical experience designing, deploying, and improving cloud environments using modern AWS services and best practices.

My focus is on building secure, scalable, and cost‑efficient solutions while continuously experimenting, breaking things, and rebuilding them to understand how systems behave under real conditions. These projects serve as both a personal knowledge base and a reference for other engineers exploring similar AWS designs.

## What This Repository Showcases
- Real-world AWS architecture patterns  
- Automated deployments and cloud operations  
- Infrastructure as Code for consistent provisioning  
- Scalable, secure, and modular cloud solutions  
- Practical troubleshooting and implementation approaches  

## Tools and Technologies

This repository uses a wide range of AWS services and cloud‑engineering tools that support real‑world architecture, automation, and deployment workflows. The goal is to build secure, scalable, and maintainable cloud environments while practicing modern engineering patterns.

### AWS Services
- **Compute:** EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda  
- **Storage & CDN:** S3, CloudFront  
- **Databases:** RDS (MySQL), DynamoDB  
- **Networking:** VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, Route Tables, Security Groups  
- **Identity & Security:** IAM, MFA enforcement, ACM (SSL certificates)  
- **Monitoring & Logging:** CloudWatch, CloudTrail  
- **DNS & Domains:** Route 53  

### Infrastructure as Code & Automation
- **Terraform** for consistent, repeatable provisioning  
- **CloudFormation** for AWS‑native templated deployments  
- **AWS CLI** for automation and operational tasks  
- **Bash/Shell scripting** for user migration, MFA enforcement, and workflow automation  

### Development & Productivity
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and project organization  
- **Git Bash** for SSH access, troubleshooting, and scripting  
- **Visual Studio Code** for application development and static site creation  
- **Architecture diagramming tools** (Mermaid, draw.io) for visualizing cloud designs  

These tools form the foundation of the projects in this repository, enabling scalable deployments, secure configurations, and hands‑on experimentation across multiple AWS services.

## Project Highlights
- End‑to‑end cloud migrations (EC2, RDS, VPC)  
- IAM automation and security enforcement at scale  
- Scalable web applications using Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB, and CloudFront  
- Static website hosting and DNS migration using S3, CloudFront, and Route 53  
- Modular patterns designed for future integration and expansion  

Each folder in this repository represents a standalone project with its own architecture, implementation details, and lessons learned.
