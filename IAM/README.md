# Automated User Migration and IAM Resource Management

This project demonstrates how I automated the migration and security hardening of AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) resources in a real-world scenario. As a Cloud Specialist, my goal was to eliminate repetitive manual work, enforce security best practices, and streamline user onboarding at scale.

## Project Overview
The organization needed to migrate **100 users** into AWS and ensure each account followed strict security requirements, including **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** and strong password policies. Performing these steps manually in the AWS Console would be slow, error‑prone, and costly.

To solve this, I automated the entire workflow using:

- **AWS CLI**
- **Shell scripting (Bash)**
- **Git Bash terminal**

## What I Automated
- Bulk creation and migration of 100 IAM users  
- Enabling MFA for each user  
- Applying IAM password policies  
- Creating and attaching an **EnforceMFAPolicy** to IAM groups  
- Reducing manual console work and enforcing consistent security standards  

## Why This Matters
Automating IAM operations is essential for Cloud Infrastructure Engineers. It ensures:

- Faster onboarding  
- Consistent security enforcement  
- Reduced operational overhead  
- Lower risk of human error  

This project reflects real-world cloud engineering responsibilities—balancing automation, security, and scalability to support organizational needs efficiently.

## Skills Demonstrated
- IAM architecture and security best practices  
- AWS CLI automation  
- Bash scripting for cloud operations  
- Policy creation and enforcement  
- Real-world user migration workflows
